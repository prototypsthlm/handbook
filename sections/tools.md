# Tools 
These are the tools that we use in our daily work. There are of course other tools in the flora, but which ones are usually depentent on decisions made on a project-to-project basis together with our customers and partners.

## Slack
When it comes to the daily communication at Prototyp, we prefer Slack before e- mail. Every project has its own channel, but there are also several general channels that it’s good to know about:
#general Prototyp’s general channel, where you can reach everyone
  ### #random 
  Discussions, random posts and other stuff that’s not important to work tasks
  ### #away 
  We use this channel to let everyone know when we’re not at the office, be it due to illness, meetings, conferences or other reasons
  ### #shopping 
  Missing anything at the office? List it in this channel, and the Office Manager will purchase it.

## Harvest
We use Harvest for project management, time reporting and billing. The general rule is: every week you should have 40h of time reported.
* Report the hours you work every day (so your Tech Lead can keep track of budgets and handle billing easily)
* Report time-off like sick leave, parental leave, vacation or approved leave of absence.
As part of your on-boarding, somebody will be tasked to get you up to speed on how we do report our time.

## Forecast
We use Forecast for resource planning and reporting absence.
For Forecast to work optimally, all users need to have read/write rights, but projects are mainly planned by tech-leads, so avoid editing planned time on your own.

## Google Drive
We use Google Drive to store files. Under Shared drives, you’ll find folders for all running projects, customers, branding and more.

## Pivotal Tracker
We use Pivotal Tracker to cooperate on sprint backlogs in a structured way. A sherpa or tech-lead will show you the ropes when you start working on your first project.

## Highfive
We use Highfive for video conferencing. With your @prototyp.se-address you are automatically authorised to start and join conferences using either a web browser, the Highfive mobile app, or the video conferencing equipment available in the Lovelace conference room in the Stockholm office.
To access Highfive via your web browser, use the address prototyp- se.highfive.com.
You can also start video meetings in Slack channels with the command /highfive.

## G Suite (formerly Google Apps)
We use G Suite for e-mail, calendars and file storage. Everyone has access to everyone’s calendars, this to make it easier to find meeting times that work for everyone. This also means that you should give private events an extra thought before entering them into the work calendar. R

Regarding file storage: in early 2019, we started the process of moving away from Dropbox. The goal is to store all company-wide files in a logical structure on GDrive, but this has taken more time than we initially thought. The goal now is to have completed the move at the end of 2019.

## Kin.hr
As a Prototyp employee, you will be invited to Kin.hr on your private e-mail. We mainly use Kin to record and discuss performance reviews and other important interpersonal meetings.
