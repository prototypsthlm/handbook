# Knowledge sharing 
## Weekly meeting
Every Monday at 9 a.m., we meet at the office and go through the coming week together. This is an important meeting, so please make sure to be on time.
Breakfast is served at the office from 8.30 am. If you know that you will be absent, please let our office manager know, so that we can minimize food waste.
## Stand-up
Tuesday - Friday at 9.30 a.m. we have a company-wide stand-up. If you’re not in the office, call in on [prototyp-se.highfive.com/prototyp](prototyp-se.highfive.com/prototyp)
## Brown bag lunches
On the first Tuesday of every month we gather for a shared lunch and listen while one of the employees talks about learnings and/or ideas (there’s a rolling schedule for this). There’s also the opportunity to invite interesting people from other companies to hold talks. Since it’s a work lunch, Prototyp will of course pick up the tab.
## Retrospectives
On the first Friday of every month we meet for an office-wide retrospective, where we review the time spent since the last retrospective by looking at what we should start, stop, and continue doing. Then we decide, through a vote, three to-do’s for the coming month, and who’s responsible for acting upon them. These to-do’s are then documented in Trello and followed-up during breakfast meetings.
## Demo Friday
Every Friday at 4 p.m. we meet for beers, snacks and the weekly demo meeting, where one of us does a show-and-tell focused on a current project. We then discuss learnings, do’s and don’ts.
