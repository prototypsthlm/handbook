# Pension & insurance 
## Avanza
As an Prototyp employee, you will receive a pension corresponding to ITP1 paid out to Avanza 75 (see [avanza.se](http://www.avanza.se)). When you’re registered in Avanza’s system, you will receive an e-mail detailing how you go about creating an account to keep track of your savings.

ITP1 works as follows; every month, money is allocated accordingly:
* 4,5% of your monthly salary up to 40,250 SEK
* 30% of any amount that exceeds 40,250 SEK

You have the right to withdraw your money after 15 years, and can always choose to move the money to some other form of pension solution. However, it is not possible to get another form of solution via Prototyp.

## Fora
As an employee at Prototyp, you are covered by life insurance (TGL) from Fora, which provides financial protection to family members in case of a work-related accident.
