# At the office
Here's what you need to know about the daily life at the Prototyp office.

## Fruit
We like fruit, but dislike pesticides. That is why we take delivery of an organic fruit basket every Monday. The contents of the basket is not that easy to change, but if you think somethings is missing and ask nicely, Bøb might go out and buy it for you.

## Coffee
We like coffee, and we like Dave Grohl. You’re welcome to make a fresh pot any time, your co-workers will like you all the more for it. Make sure to activate the coffee script on Slack, so that Dave can tell us when the coffee is ready. Since late 2019, we have a new coffee machine that *might* need some explaining before using it the first time.

## Keys
You’ll get two keys to the office. The one which serial no. ends with 849 gives access to all doors leading to the office, including the elevator. The other key (ending with 403) gives access to the gate at street level and also enables you to use the elevator outside of office hours (there’s a keyhole by the buttons, turn the key while pressing the button).

If you’re the last to leave the office, make sure that all doors (including the one on floor 5) are locked, and that the elevator door is locked with the padlock that you can find on the kitchen counter to the left of the elevator doors.

## Recycling
There are recycling bins for plastic, metal, glass, cartons and aluminium cans in the cabinets under the microwave ovens. Non-recyclables go in the bin in the kitchen area.
Equipment

## As an Prototyp employee, you should have the following equipment:
• Monitor (optional)
• Computer (an Apple laptop, if your work tasks don’t require something else)
• Phone (a model of your choice, we try to avoid the highest memory
configurations, though, given that they basically add another phone price-
wise)
• A table with adjustable height
• A comfortable chair

We replace our phones and computers when needed, but at the earliest after three (3) years of use.

## Telness
All employees are offered a 10 Gb/month mobile subscription with Telness, which is paid by Prototyp. You can either choose to port your current number to Telness (don't worry, you can always get it back), or get a new number.
You can, of course, choose to use another mobile operator, but unless you have a very good reason to do so, Prototyp will not pay for the contract.
