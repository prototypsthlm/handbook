# Vacation & absence
As a Prototyp employee, you are entitled to 30 days of paid vacation each year, and they are earned between April 1st and March 31st.
When you want to use your vacation days, please follow the steps below to avoid planning mix-ups and misunderstandings:
1. Check with the Tech-Lead(s) for your current project(s) that your vacation plans are OK from a project perspective.
2. Check your vacation plans with your manager.
3. When you have an OK on all fronts, enter your vacation into Forecast.
4. Vacay!
## Sick leave
Sick leave, like all other absence, is reported in Harvest. It’s also polite to let your colleagues know when you’re missing, using the Slack channel **#away.**
## Other Absence
We believe in teamwork and collaboration, and that the best environment to foster it is in-person, together. That’s why we work, as much as possible, from the office.
Sometimes there’s a handy-man to be let in or a couch to be delivered. And that is, of course, totally ok.
## Flex-time
To make laying the pieces in everyone’s life puzzle a little easier we offer you the possibility of flexible working hours. If there’s a special event in your life that needs office-hour attention - you take responsibility for, and keep count of this yourself. You make sure it doesn’t affect your current projects and, in general, keep in mind the value of sharing a workplace and being together at the same place at the same time.
