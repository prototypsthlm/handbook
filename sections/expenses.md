# Expenses
Sometimes situations might occur where you have to spend your own money on Prototyp’s account. Be it buying coffee for an interesting contact at a conference, or picking up that new dev tool that will help you become even more efficient at work.
When this happens, log in to Harvest and create an expense report as follows:
* Go to Timesheets and pick Expenses in the top menu.
* Press the New expense button, enter the date when the purchase was
performed and choose Prototyp/Internal as project.
* Choose a suitable expense category under Category and attach a digital
copy of the receipt. Finally enter the amount under Amount.
* Press Save Expense.
The expense will be paid-out on your next salary. If it’s a big expense and you want the money a bit faster, talk to Tobias B and he’ll make it happen.
