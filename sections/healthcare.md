# Healthcare
If you like moving around and keeping in shape, then we think that is an excellent idea. It helps one clear one’s head, and often come with the added benefit of coming up with great solutions to tricky problems. To encourage this, all Prototyp employees are entitled to the following:
* Healthcare renumeration synced with a yearly membership at Friskis & Svettis in Stockholm (3,830 SEK in 2020)
* The right to excercise during work hours for 1,5 hours/week (we try running together on Tuesdays and Wednesdays).
  
## Training gear
On the shelves by the restrooms, you will find training gear in the form of shirts, shorts and towels. Feel free to use them, and put them in the wash basket to the left of the shelves when you’re done with them, so that they can be washed and returned to the shelves. Please don’t bring training gear home with you, or at least make sure that you bring whatever you’ve used back to the office as soon as possible.
