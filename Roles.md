# Roles
These are the roles of the employees at Prototyp. We strive to keep things as simple as possible, and most of us write code in one way or another. There, however, a few variations as well as exceptions; and they are explained below.

## Developer
Developers are the core of Prototyp. As a developer, you will write lots and lots of code. You will also help out with estimates, quality assurance, technical sanity checks and other stuff that helps us be great at what we do.

## Tech-lead
At Prototyp, we don’t believe in the middle-man, so we have opted not to have project managers. Instead, for every project, a developer will shoulder the role as tech-lead. As tech-lead, you will make sure that all information needed for the current project to move along at the required pace is available. You will handle communication and meetings with the customers, as well as being shoulder for the other developers in the project to lean on.

## Tech Manager
As a developer at Prototyp you will be assigned a Tech Manager. What is that, you ask? Easy. It’s one of two senior developers that will help support you in growing in your role at Prototyp. Your TM is your manager, and the one who will be there for you for any kind of question, and the one legally responsible for you. You will take regular walks with your TM to make sure that they know your current thoughts and needs in connection to your role, and they are also responsible for your equipment needs, the education allowance that is mentioned below.

## Business-lead
As Business-lead, your mission is to find and sell projects that are fun and stimulating for developers. This requires a whole lot of meetings/lunches/fika-
sessions. That’s why the business-lead is the person who perhaps spends the least time at the office.

## Office manager
To make sure that the daily stuff at the office runs smoothly, we have an office manager that comes in twice a week. The office manager makes sure that we have everything we need in terms of office supplies, fika, equipment and so on. He will also make sure that the office stays a nice place to hang out.

## CEO
As CEO of Prototyp, you are responsible for making sure that Prototyp stays alive and well. You do this by making sure that the company has sound finances, that employees are happy and feel that they can develop in their respective roles within the company, and through continuous development of Prototyp as a company. The CEO is also manager for all other Prototyp employees, as well as legally responsible for the company.
